# Final Proposal
## Group: Angela, Brett, Gabriel, Isaac

Project: The fitness tracker will incorporate accountability features by allowing friends and family to support and motivate users throughout their fitness journey. Research shows that working towards goals with other fosters greater success and consistency.

- What will the project do?
> Assist in health and fitness tracking
> - Input and calculation of caloric requirements based on height, weight, potentially BMI and then setting a value based off your goals (weight, timeline)
>
> Introduce a level of accountability into your fitness journey.
> - Workout check-ins/streaks. Allow users to publicly log a workout to their community.
> - Allow members to post images of their meals to encourage healthy eating in their fitness community.
> - Using a "timeline" where users can make and interact with posts from other members of their fitness community.

- What problem does it solve?
> Saying on track in your fitness when going alone is the most difficult part.
> 
> Helping people to not feel alone in their journey is extremely beneficial.


- What is the target audience for your program?
> Users who potentially need a little help with accountability.
> 
> Groups of users who want to tackle fitness goals together.

- What technology will you use to create, manage, and complete the project?
> Version Storage and Project Tracking
> - Github: Using GitHub repository management, we can all have access to the latest version of the project. We can also use GitHub's project management and utilize their Kanban style board to track our projects progress.
> 
> Webapp Languages & Architecture
> - SvelteKit: A javascript web framework the combines the features of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, while allowing the frontend and backend to coexist in the same codebase.
> - Typescript: Javascript with types. For programming.
> 
> Database
> - MongoDB: For a NoSQL approach. Very standard DB used in industry.
> - EdgeDB: A newer SQL approach type of database. Potentially results in much less coding overall.

- What challenges do you foresee with your chosen project?
> Technical issues with new languages and frameworks that members of the group haven't used.
> 
> Complications between the tech stack and getting the Language, framework, and database to interact correctly
